Script to calculate what stocks are more profitable in python

Example:
        savings = 250
        current_value = [175,133,109,210,97]
        future_value = [200,125,128,228,133]

To maximise profits, the investor should buy stocks at indices 2 and 4 for an investment of 109 + 97 = 206. At the end of the year the stocks are sold for 128 + 133 = 261, so total profit is 261 - 206 = 55.

Will have the output of:
        55

EXECUTION:
    - run tests: python -m unittest discover
